## 11. Ambiguities & Clarifications Needed

| ID | Area | Ambiguity | Recommendation | Decision |
|----|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| AMB-01 | Coding Platform Integration | Spec says "coding-platform integrations" but doesn't specify which platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.) | Support configurable platform connectors; start with mock data simulating LeetCode-like structure | Use mock connector + configurable adapter pattern |
| AMB-02 | Academic Records | "Links academic-record accounts" — no schema or source specified | Model academic records as a structured entity with GPA, courses, grades; ingestible via upload or API | Create an academic_records table + CSV upload |
| AMB-03 | Readiness Score Formula | Score composition mentioned but exact formula not specified | Implement configurable weighted scoring per Master prompt §16 with default weights | Configurable via admin panel |
| AMB-04 | Interview Agent Scope | "Runs mock-interview practice" — unclear if real-time chat, async Q&A, or both | Implement async Q&A mock interview with AI-generated questions and evaluation | Start with async, extensible to real-time |
| AMB-05 | Role-Family Packs (Lab 13) | "Software, core, analytics, higher studies" — no detailed specialization rules | Define role-family-specific question banks, skill taxonomies, and matching rules per family | Create pluggable specialist configurations |
| AMB-06 | Bias Check | "Shortlisting is checked for bias" (Table 7) — no specific bias metrics defined | Implement demographic parity checks and flag statistical anomalies across student cohorts | Use statistical analysis, not demographic data collection |
| AMB-07 | Learning Roadmap Structure | Roadmap mentioned but format not specified | Structured milestones with resources, timelines, priorities linked to skill gaps | Create configurable roadmap templates |
| AMB-08 | Multi-Student Parallel Processing | Lab 8 mentions parallel student processing — unclear if batch or individual triggers | Support both: individual student trigger + batch processing for placement seasons | Individual primary; batch as admin feature |
